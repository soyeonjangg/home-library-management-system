# home-library-management-system

## Inspiration/Issues
- My family uses both E-books and physical books. 
- As we're organizing our bookshelf, I thought it would be nice to have some sort of book management system so that we don't purchase duplicates as we have limited space for books and books end up at wrong place.

## Goal
- Give permission to certain people in the household to remove/modify/create books in the system
- Connect to database to store a list of books in the household -> Database structure/architecture
- Implement searching method to see which books are at home
- Create a wishlist (not a priority)
